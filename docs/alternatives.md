If [noaa-apt](./index.html) is not useful to you, these are the alternatives I
found, as of August 2018:

- [WXtoImg], by far the most popular, lots of features but the site looks dead
  forever.

- [WXtoImg Restored], unofficial mirror with installers recovered by users.

- [xwxapt], receives and decodes live, something like [WXtoImg]. I should try it
  sometime.

- [atp-dec/apt-dec], works really good. Keep in mind that the [1.7 release]
  looks newer than the [repo's master branch]. I tried several times to compile
  the [repo's master branch] without success, later I realized that there was a
  newer [1.7 release] and it worked.

- [pietern/apt137], written in C, extremely fast.

- [zacstewart/apt-decoder], written in Python, slower than the others but really
  simple. I wrote the syncing algorithm.

- [Alexander-Barth/APTDecoder.jl], written in Julia. Never tested it but has
  false color and map overlay.

- [ThatcherC/APT3000], written in JavaScript, looks very fast.

- [rsj56/apitran], fork of [zacstewart/apt-decoder] with some extra automation.

Others I found on GitHub:

- [brainwagon/noaa-apt], written in C, does not sync images.

- [LongHairedHacker/apt-decoder]. written in Rust.

- [dlew1716/APT], written in Python and C++, not easily usable.

- [toastedcornflakes/APT], written in Python, not easily usable.

- [la1k/wxfetch], fork of [atp-dec/apt-dec], I never tried it.

- [SopaXorzTaker/napt], written in C, can't figure out how to use it.

I measured the speed of most of them using the `time` utility from bash, and
made a comparison of the results on `./extra/comparison.ods`.
